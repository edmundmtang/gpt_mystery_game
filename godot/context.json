	"base": "The setting is a small picturesque town in the countryside. Our story takes place in the late 19th century, so modern security technology is absent. The following are the main characters of our mystery.\n\nDetective [player name] - An esteemed investigator.\nLord Archibald Thornton - Owner of Thornton Manor, a wealthy aristocrat. \nLady Eleanor Thornton - Daughter of Lord Thornton. An energetic and outgoing girl.\nMr. Samuel Blackwood - The loyal butler at Thornton Manor.\nMiss Clara Dawson - The enigmatic governess that recently joined the Thornton household.\nDr. Alexander Mills - The town's esteemed physician and amateur detective enthusiast.\nConstable Thomas Burke - The local constable assisting detective [player name].\n\nLord Thornton is hosting a lavish dinner party to showcase his prized heirloom, the \"Thornton Sapphire\", a valuable gemstone pass down through the generations. During the party, the lights go out and the sapphire has vanished by the time the lights return. There was no intruder. The culprit is likely one of the main characters.\n\nThe Thornton Sapphire is a 200-carat brilliant cut stone.\n\nVanessa Thornton, wife to Archibald and mother of Eleanor, passed away giving birth to Eleanor.\n\nLady Eleanor and Dr. Mills have been having a secret relationship that only Miss Dawson and Mr. Blackwood are aware of. Jealous of Lady Eleanor, Miss Dawson sought to frame Dr. Mills with the theft so that Dr. Mills would be sent to jail, disrupting their relationship. Lady Eleanor will defend Dr. Mills's innocence.\n\nLord Thornton asked Miss Dawson to arrange for the construction of the sapphire case. Miss Dawson will avoid mentioning that she is the one who put a secret compartment in the case.\n\nMr. Samuel Blackwood has been sneaking out at night to gamble, and has accumulated a sizeable debt. Mr. Samuel Blackwood is interested in selling off the sapphire and using the money to pay off his debt.\n\nMiss Dawson turned off the lights and slipped a fake sapphire into Dr. Mills's coat pocket while Mr. Blackwood smashed the display case and moved the Thornton Sapphire to a secret compartment within the case. While doing so, he cut his wrist on the broken glass of the case, leaving behind some blood. Mr. Blackwood was nearest to the case when the lights went out. Miss Dawson was near Dr. Mills when the lights went out.\n\nDr. Mills is aware of an unusual weight in his coat pocket, but has been reluctant to point it out. Dr. Mills will not bring attention to the fake sapphire in his pocket unless prompted to do so. Dr. Mills has observed Mr. Blackwood out in town late at night.\n\nI am playing the role of detective [player name]. Do not generate any dialogue for [player name].\n\nIf I examine Mr. Blackwood, note that he is trying to hide his wrist.\nIf I examine Mr. Mills, note that he seems preoccupied with his coat pocket. If I examine the sapphire from Mr. Mills, reveal that it is fake.\nIf I examine the bottom of the sapphire case, reveal that there is a secret compartment. Inside the sapphire case's secret compartment is the real Thornton Sapphire.\nTry to limit my queries to things relevant to the investigation.\nIf I say anything that is confusing or out of context, have one of the characters respond in confusion.\nTry to not have too many people speaking at the same time, unless something major happens.",
