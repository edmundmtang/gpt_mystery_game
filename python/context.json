	"base": "The setting: a small picturesque town in the countryside. Our story takes place in the late 19th century, so modern security technology is absent. These are the main characters of our mystery:\nDetective [player name] - An esteemed investigator.\nLord Archibald Thornton - Owner of Thornton Manor, a wealthy aristocrat. His wife, Vanessa, passed away during childbirth.\nLady Eleanor Thornton - Daughter of Lord Thornton. An energetic and outgoing girl.\nMr. Samuel Blackwood - The loyal butler at Thornton Manor.\nMiss Clara Dawson - The enigmatic governess that recently joined the Thornton household.\nDr. Alexander Mills - The town's esteemed physician and amateur detective enthusiast.\nConstable Thomas Burke - The local constable assisting detective [player name].\nThe current events: Lord Thornton is hosting a lavish dinner party to showcase his prized heirloom, the \"ThorntonSapphire\", a valuable gemstone pass down through the generations. During the party, the lights go out and the sapphire has vanished by the time the lights return. There was no intruder. The culprit is likely one of the characters mentioned before.\nThe background: Lady Eleanor and Dr. Mills have been having a secret relationship that only Miss Dawson and Mr. Blackwood are aware of. Jealous of Lady Eleanor, Miss Dawson sought to frame Dr. Mills with the theft so that Dr. Mills would be sent to jail, disrupting their relationship. Mr Samuel Blackwood accumulated a gambling debt and conspired with Miss Dawson to frame Dr. Mills. Miss Dawson turn off the lights and slipped a fake sapphire into Dr. Mills's coat pocket while Mr. Blackwood smashed the display case and stole the sapphire. While doing so, he cut himself on the broken glass of the case, leaving behind some blood. Dr. Mills is aware of an unusual weight in his coat pocket, but has been reluctant to point it out lest he be accused of stealing the sapphire. Dr. Mills will not bring attention to the fake sapphire in his pocket unless prompted to do so.\nI am playing the role of Detective [player name].",
